# Criteria-C
TWS: I have not done anything on WebEd, I don't know css that well as I have not learned it unlike html.

TWS: If I had made it I would create tabs with very detailed information, and all of the commands for html and css. Simple or difficult to understand all information will be there ready for students to view and use them. I would even make a tab for students to test out and play with commands.

TWS: If i had made it I would have sort of followed my wired frame with a slight change here and there.

TWS: Extra tabs were necessary as I wanted it to be more organized so specific information can be found easier?
